# Neil Chrome Extension
A chrome extension that has all my personal links.

Consists of a manifest.json file configuration and a popup html that uses active tab permissions.
A straightforward design, and was easy to publish.

## What I Learned

 - the anatomy of a chrome extension
 - configuring the extension's manifest.json file
 - interesting implementations of scripts
 - typical Google store requirements for assets
